        <h1>Segun Olabisi</h1>
        <p><em>Architectural CGI expert, Founder of <strong>Prodesign Studios</strong> and an advocate of Sustainable Cities.</em></p>
        <p>Architecture graduate with a solid design background, industrial experience. I am very much driven by the desire to take on Urban-Architectural challenges in a bid to turn them into inhabitable and sustainable spaces. In a world where
          technology
          accelerates our future and architecture being the canvas of the world, I am interested in exploring traditional building materials and their roles in the modern architecture of urban spaces.</p>
